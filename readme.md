# Facebook Ads Library MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Facebook Ads Library.

With this you can search Facebook's public ads library for any company or brand, see what they're currently running and analyze their advertising. You can analyse ad images/text, get video links, compare companies' strategies, and get insights into what's working in their campaigns.

Here's an example of what you can do when it's connected to Claude.

## Example Prompts

```plaintext
How many ads is 'AnthropicAI' running? Whatâ€™s their split across video and image?
```

```plaintext
What messaging is 'AnthropicAI' running right now in their ads?
```

```plaintext
Do a deep comparison to the messaging between 'AnthropicAI', 'Perplexity AI' and 'OpenAI'. Give it a nice forwardable summary.
